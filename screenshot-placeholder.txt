# Screenshot Placeholder

For a complete WordPress theme, you should add a screenshot.png file (880x660px) showing a preview of your theme.

This file should be placed at the root of the theme directory as `screenshot.png`.

You can create a screenshot by:
1. Setting up WordPress with your theme
2. Creating sample content with WooCommerce products
3. Taking a screenshot of the homepage
4. Resizing to 880x660 pixels
5. Saving as screenshot.png

Recommended tools:
- GIMP (free)
- Photoshop
- Online screenshot tools
